# Coding-Practice
Welcome to Codes Repository! This repository is a collection of Python programs covering a wide range of topics, from number theory to string manipulation


## Installation

In order to use this project, your computer must have Python 3.x installed. Downloads for Python are available from the official website.

After installing Python, you have two options: use Git to clone the repository to your local computer, or download the zip file straight from GitHub.

The repository is divided into many parts, each of which has Python programs covering distinct subjects:
## Dictionary
## Linked List
## OOPS
## Patterns


# 1. LinkedList

The Linked Lists section covers the implementation of singly linked lists in Python. Linked lists are fundamental data structures that consist of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

# 2. Dictionary
The Dictionaries section delves into the Python dictionary data structure. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs, providing fast access to values based on their keys.

# 3. OOPS
The OOP section illustrates the concept of Object-Oriented Programming in Python. This approach allows you to model real-world entities as objects, with attributes and behaviors.

# 4. Patterns
The Patterns section introduces various patterns and shapes that you can create using Python's print functionality. These patterns are great for understanding nested loops and enhancing your problem-solving skills.
